# Keeper App

A note taking app to practice using React concepts. 
## Concepts explored

Using more complex states inside useState, to create an object that can be tapped into using dot notation. 
Destructing the "event" from onChange and using the spread operator to add new values to state.object.

Makes use of .filter() to sort through an state.array to remove deleted items.

First exploration of the new date() object in javaScript.

## Future plans
To turn this into a full MERN stack app and add a useFetch custom hook to GET, POST, PATCH data
