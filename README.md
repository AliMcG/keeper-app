# Keeper App

A note taking app to practice using React concepts. 
## Concepts explored

Using more complex states inside useState, to create an object that can be tapped into using dot notation. 
Destructing the "event" from onChange and using the spread operator to add new values to state.object.

Makes use of .filter() to sort through an state.array to remove deleted items.
Using functions within .filter to sort an array.

First exploration of the new date() object in javaScript.

Full MERN stack app and added useFetch custom hook to GET.
Discovered that customHooks don't work inside other functions.

Used axios to POST and DELETE data

Used some icons from [material-ui](https://mui.com/material-ui/material-icons/?query=thinking)

## Backend server
The express.js server for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/AliMcG/portfolio-backend-mongodb). It connects to mongobd using mongoose

## Authentication
The app uses auth0.com to handle user logins. This has been verified through the google.api service.
Explored some of the customizations available for the universal login on auth0.com.
